Description: All-in-one tool for Debian-derived distribution maintenance
 IRGSH (pronunciation: irgis) is an all-in-one tool to create and maintain
 Debian-derived GNU/Linux distribution: from packaging to repository, from
 ISO build to release management.
 .
 This package contains all IRGSH server components:
  * irgsh-chief - acts as the master controller
  * irgsh-builder - builder worker for package building
  * irgsh-repo - repository server for package storage
  * irgsh-iso - ISO image builder
  * irgsh-cli - command-line client tool for package maintainers
 .
 A minimal IRGSH ecosystem requires irgsh-chief, irgsh-builder, and
 irgsh-repo services running, along with a Redis server for task queuing.
